Easily transfer a file from web to any platform that reads a QR code. Node js has been used to create back-end of this project. Bootstrap template 'Grayscale' has been used for front end.

## Tools and Technologies used

* QRcode Library of JQuery: It was used to convert the link generated by the server into QR Code.
* GrayScale Theme: Written in Bootstrap, this was used as the front end theme.
